# CircuiTikZ Tool
This project is designed to be an open-source tool for creating schematics with CircuiTikz.
The goal of this project isn't to do everything with CircuiTikz, just handle the tedious parts of creating circuits in LaTex.
Component labels, display parameters, and other configuration options are editable by the user through text fields.
Currently most of the basic functionality is implemented in the program.

This fork just adds some quality of life features, but mainly makes it use my regional notation for electronic components.

### List of notable changes
* config is stored outside of executable's directory
* moved to European notation
